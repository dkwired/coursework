LAB ASSIGNMENT 5

In this lab assignment you will implement the algorithm from problem
2.32 of the text -- finding the closest pair in a given set of points
in the plane.

This is a somewhat sophisticated divide-and-conquer algorithm that we
have not covered in class.  The first part of the lab meeting will be
spent in group discussing the algorithm with the TA at the whiteboard,
not sitting at the computer.

Please read problem 2.32 on the last page of chapter 2 of the text.
You can find chapter 2 online at the link below:

Lab Assignment:

Add your name etc. to the top of the file lab5.py

Complete the partial implementation of the algorithm in the file
lab5.py . You can modify code in any way you like. Your program
should take the name of the input file as a command-line parameter.
(For example, after running "make" to compile the file, the command

    ./lab5.py <input_10.txt

should print out the closest pair among the points in the file
input_10.txt.)

Once your code is working, you can comment out the call to slow_cp()
(it is there just for checking your closest_pair() routine).

To turn in your assignment, submit lab5.py.
