      Number with same-slice carry load:         0
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   965 out of  37,680    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,506
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           561 out of   2,506   22%
    Number with an unused LUT:               1,199 out of   2,506   47%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         746 out of   2,506   29%
    Number of unique control sets:               9
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               1 out of 301,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
