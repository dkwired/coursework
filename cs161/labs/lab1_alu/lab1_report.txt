Assignment: Lab 1
I acknowledge all content is original.

I. Lab objective
The lab objective was to introduce us to using Xilinx ISE 13 tool-chain and develop a ALU.

II . Personal contributions
The work was shared for this exercise. As a group we followed the steps to create a Xilinx project, synthesize, test, and place & route the design. Wojciech did the logic and coding for the ALU and David aided in the design of the ALU as well as coding.

III. Skill learned & knowledge gained.
For this lab project we developed our knowledge of how to implement a ALU design in Xilinx; as well as, use a test bench to similate our design.

IV. Known bugs locations
After several designs...We tested our design with all possible cases, the only bug was with our Signed Subtractor in the case of a carryout issue with -3 - -1 = -2. No idea why this was happening.

V. Feedback on the lab
Overall the lab was...interesting. Feel free to update any old files. =P
